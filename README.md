# CTH
Basic (incomplete @ 4/7/2016) UI elements have been added. There are likely still bootstrap elements with default styling seeping through.
If any of these styling issues are discovered, I (Meta), will work on them as they come.


# PAGES
- index.html (basic portal layout and ui dev testing)
- alerts.html (bootstrap alerts)
- article_short.html (single short article, w/ read more)
- article_full.html (full article, w/ comments & inputs) **needs pagination for comments**
- register.html (1/3 - new user registration example)
- validate_email.html (2/3 - new user registration email validation example)
- add_first_character.html (3/3 - new user registration, character addition example)
- inc/nav.html (fixed navigation and banner, include into pages)
